STEPS FOR CURATING THE KEYWORD, "PRAXIS"

As you complete these steps, we ask you to keep the following questions in mind: What makes our keyword unique or exemplary to digital pedagogy? In terms of key concepts and practices, what should we communicate to other practitioners interested in our keyword (in particular) and digital pedagogy (in general)? When we teach or facilitate with our keyword in mind, what materials do we reference, draw upon, or otherwise integrate into our pedagogy?

Please note: we are not asking you to advocate for, say, digital humanities or teaching with technology. That is, we are not assuming that digital technologies or digital culture are necessarily conducive to pedagogy. We are interested in limitations as well as possibilities, with a focus on the everyday stuff of teaching --- the stuff that may not be included with journal articles or book chapters on the scholarship of teaching and learning.

1) When you have a moment, I recommend visiting our working template for all keywords: https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/!template.md.

As you'll notice, the emphasis is on curating pedagogical resources for each keyword. In this sense, tho inspired by Raymond Williams, we are not asking for a Williams-style entry. We are also not asking for much writing (a maximum of 3000 words, including works cited and annotations). That said, we hope this draft will not consume much of your time, especially when compared with, say, a journal article or book chapter. We imagine that practitioners as experienced as you will have most of these materials on hand, ready to share.

2) While reviewing the template, let us know if you have any questions about its six sections: a) author names (as you'd like them to appear in the publication); b) a list of the ten (no more, no less) resources you're curating for your entry; c) a curatorial statement, where you can explain/rationalize your ten selections; d) the ten resources themselves (which you'll likely put on a server for remote access) plus annotations for each; e) five related materials for future reference; and f) works cited.

3) Once you've reviewed the template and contacted me with any questions, please author the entry in Markdown. (Again, no more than 3000 words.) From what I gather, Markdown is already used --- popular, even --- at your lab. The editorial team will be using Pandoc to convert MD files into other formats, including HTML.

4) Once the entry is written, please email it, together with a URL for the copies of your ten resources, to me (jentery@uvic.ca).

5) Once we receive your entry, we will review and edit it (where necessary), return the proof to you (for approval/revision), and then forward the approved proof to the MLA. Later, the keyword and the entire Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities collection will be made available online (open access) for open review. That said, please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about the open review process, or about rendering your work discoverable online. In the interests of transparency, with the MLA, we are still fleshing out the particulars of this review process, and we want to keep our curators' needs and interests in mind as we do so.

DEADLINE

In order to meet the terms of our contract with the MLA, the deadline for the first draft of this keyword is:

1 NOVEMBER 2014

We realize this timing is tight, but we hope the labor involved is manageable between now and November. Thank you for understanding.

Finally, as we proceed toward publication, we may ask you to provide us with permissions for your resources, where necessary. For now, tho, those permissions are not necessary.
