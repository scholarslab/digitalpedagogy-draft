(Extra)ordinary *Materials* is a course focusing on "thinking and experimenting with materials that have extraordinary properties around ordinary practices as an entry point for identifying new affordances in form-giving work." With a detailed syllabus and a blend of intriguing readings, hands-on experiements, and student participation, (Extra)ordinary *Materials* exemplifies *Praxis* by 
*deep investigations of materials to engage ideas of "mutability, reproduction, age and belonging"
*thoughtful learning outcomes with explicit pairing of hands-on work and theoretical readings to best explore range of materials and properties.
*readings paired with hands-on (individual and class exercises) investigations
*reporting back
*intentional interventions and less intended (less noticed)
interventions such as aging or wear

Guidelines for use: excellent overview and syllabus, so readily
accessible. Could integrate the practice of individual investigtations easily, in-class experiments more difficult, but could be revised to adapt to wide-range of courses (examples!!)
