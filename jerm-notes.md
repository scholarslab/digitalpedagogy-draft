# Jeremy's Notes

**Broader Summary/Notes**

For me, these resources espose several things about what *praxis* can
do: use artifacts and the making of those artifacts to *realize, expose,
critique, and generate* theoretical/intellectual concepts.

* **Praxis as representation of theory** - You can set out to make a
  thing that embodies an existing theory or idea.
* **Praxis as teacher/illuminator of theory** - You can make a thing
  and, in the process of doing so, reveal and learn
  theoretical/intellectual concepts.
* **Praxis as critic of theory** - You can make a thing and, in the
  process or with the result, challenge or question existing concepts.
* **Praxis as genesis of theory** - You can make a thing and, in the
  process or result, come up with a new theory or idea.

## Bibliocircuitry

* Favors critical making and prototyping over usability and finished,
  polished products as a method of inquiry.
* Focuses on *reflective design* as a way of transgressing lines of
  convention. Intentionally provocative in an effort to interrogate
  assumptions and expectations: Not afraid to ask "what if?"
* Reflective designs work well as prototypes, and embody critical making
  practices.
* Their projects and process exemplify *praxis* as a mode of inquiry.
  Made things, and the process in which they are made, expose
  theoretical/intellectual work. Goals can change through the process of
  building.

## How Did They Make That?

* Resources aim to expose the parts and processes that go into building
  various DH projects.
* Blurs genres of documentation, tutorial, review, and case study.
* Beckons the need for more transparency in projects like this. Can only
  know so much as an outsider what tools and techniques actually went
  into a project. But from this, you could argue that it's less
  important to actually know how a project was actually made, and more
  important to be able to speculate at how projects might have been
  made. There's freedom in guessing. Less about followign step-by-step
  isntructions, and using the exact toolset a project used, and more
  about understanding genres of tools
* Great exercise from this would be to find a project you like,
  interrogate why you like it—what features are appealing or
  intriguing—and then investigate possible ways of replicating that
  project.
* Pretty similar to *Kits for Cultural History* in spirit and goals,
  though this could have more discussion about broader concepts. May be
  a bit too procedural, or a bit too concerned with working parts in
  places. But you need this.

## Theory as Praxis

* Worries that technology isn't deterministic or influential
  enough to break conventions of critical thought.
* Similar to *Bibliocircuitry*, makes a case for *speculative computing*
  that eschews "closure", formality, and control, and engages in
  *poesis* that helps us to imagine things we do not know or have not
  considered.
* McGann's point that print "assume an obligation to completion and
  completeness" that results in failure when fulfilled. (688)
* Praxis produces theoretical contexts upon which humanities scholarship
  depends.

## Kits for Cultural History

* A collection of kits that help humanists explore questions and topics
  related to cultural history.
* Kits are not intended to be simple instruction manuals, with
  step-by-step instructions toward
* Examples include: *Electric Jewels*, which explores 19th-century
  electric jewelry, and *Tennis for Two*, which looks at the first video
  game.
* The discussions surrounding these kits highlight, for me, the more
  interesting aspects of praxis work: How to document and share it with
  others. See esp. Macpherson's post, that this is deeper than simply
  eschewing prodecure or problem solving.
* I would include these not only for the actual examples they've put
  together, but the process by which they've put them together and
  shared.
