## Curatorial Statement (roughly 750-800 words, MLA Format)

```
The curatorial statement expresses your vision of the keyword — what
it means in a pedagogical context and how you approached the task of
curating pedagogical resources around it. Statements can include some or
all of the following:

* Vision statement (how do you envison or understand this keyword and
  its relation to pedagogy?)
* Scholarly rationale for selections
* Criteria for selections (why were the specific curated resources
  selected?)
* Important issues (why teach this now? why does this topic matter for
  students? for faculty? for a field? what makes this keyword unique or
  exemplary for digital pedagogy?)
* Particular intersections with your pedagogical philosophy/teaching
  conditions (how and where do you teach issues related to this keyword?
  in what course(s)? with what learning expectations/outcomes in mind?
  with or without what resources? what are your students' backgrounds,
  interests, or investments?)
  ```

## Curated Pedagogical Resources (ten resources, each with metadata, a screenshot, and a 150-word annotation)

```
* Screenshot (PNG or JPG), if applicable
* Source URL
* A Copy of the Resource (in HTML, PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, RTF, MP3, MP4,
  MOV, PNG, or JPG), if possible
* Name of Creator
* Attribution Information (Author, University/College)
* An annotation of **no more than 150 words** that includes:
    * Brief statement of Aim/Purpose of the Resource (what is it?)
    * Brief statement on Its Relevance to the Keyword (why is it
      important/useful, what does it do well, how does it exemplify
      digital pedagogy)
    * Guidelines for Use (how to integrate it into a course, what might
      need revision/adaptation)

Feel free to push these resources to a server for remote access, and
then send us the URL. In your Markdown file, you can just include file
names (e.g., screenshot1.png) for our reference, with the annotations
and other information following them. Ultimately, all of your resources
will be intergrated in this repository (curateteaching/digitalpedagogy).
```

## 5. Related Materials (Bulleted List)

```
In MLA format, list five related items or resources that are
informative for teaching with your keyword in mind. **Please only
include five items. No more, no less.**

For each item, include Author, Title, and URL

Items may include:
* Scholarly journal article
* Book
* Video, audio, or other dynamic media
* Crowdsourced document
* Blog post
* Website
```

## 6. Works Cited

```
A works cited for all references in your entry, including your ten
resources, your five related materials, and anything referenced in your
curatorial statement.
```
