## Curatorial Statement (roughly 750-800 words, MLA Format)

### Vision Statement: How do you envision or understand “praxis” and its
relation to pedagogy?

Praxis, as we understand it and practice it in our day-to-day academic
work, is generally less concerned with end products, and more concerned
by the *process* in which things are made, and the manner in which they
are made. More specifically, we see praxis as the process of making to
realize, expose, critique, and generate theoretical/ideological
concepts. We find four particularly useful applications of praxis.

* **Praxis as an embodiment of an idea.** Set out to make or do something
  that embodies an existing theory or idea.
* **Praxis as teacher/illuminator of an idea.** In the process of making
  or doing something, reveal and learn theoretical/intellectual.
  concepts.
* **Praxis as critic of an idea.** In the process of making or doing
  something, challenge or question existing concepts.
* **Praxis as genesis of an idea.** In the process of making or doing,
  devise a new theory or idea.

### Praxis and Our Pedagogy

Almost everything we do—our internal projects, our collaborations with
faculty, our graduate fellowships and training opportunities—features
praxis as a central concern and goal. We more interested in making
people, not tools, and in that endeavor we almost always emphasize
learning *how* to do something and *why* to do something, and not merely
make things for people. Praxis is a central tenent of the ethos of the
Scholars' Lab and  for nearly all our interactions with collaborators.

We have two graduate fellowship programs where we emphasize the
importance of praxis in humanities work: Digital Humanities Fellowship
and Praxis Program Fellowship. Our Digital Humanities Fellowship offers
students time and community to implement a digital component of their
research. Scaffolding tech skills with mentorship models an iterative
process of collaborative work. The Fellowship carves out time for
reflection, experimentation, as well as support for implementing the
results into a digital project.

Similarly, our Praxis Program reimagines graduate training in the
humanities for the demands of the digital age. The Praxis Programs
unites six graduate students from across the humanities and social
sciences to design and build a digital tool. Like the Digital Humanities
Fellowship, the Praxis Program seeks to provide time--time for
exploration, for reflection, for collaboration--to reimagine what
scholarly work looks like. Praxis Fellows work alongside the Scholars'
Lab staff throughout the arch of creating, building, and launching a
digital project.

[Jeremy--I am trying to say something about how the program
intends to integrate both the leveraging of the various skills and
disciplines each Praxer brings as well as the technical skills learned;
that we strive to make transparent how we do as much as why we do...]

Our students are typically humanities graduate students, and with a few
exceptions are PhD students who have yet to advance. With both of these
programs, we're less concerned with finished, polished products, and
more concerned with ensuring that the process of making is
instructive.

We feel it is especially important to nurture an environment that
encourages praxis.

### Rationale and Criteria

Our approach in selecting resources involved three broad requirements:
First, we decided to select publicly available, open access resources.
Praxis seems most successful when as many impedements to development and
process are removed.

Second, we wanted to include a range of resources: Syllabi that discuss,
organize, and present praxis to students; Lessons that detail process
behind a particular praxis assigment and possible outcomes; Project
showcases that d emonstrate completed assigments and reflections on
those assigments, or elaborate on the tools and process that go into
making a particular project; Articles that reflect and elaborate on the
importance of praxis for teaching and learning. It was important to us
to include resources ranging in application and type, to show that
considerations of praxis can be addressed in a variety of formats.

Third, we felt it important to select resources that demonstrate the
interconnected, symbiotic relationships among praxis, theory, and
product. All of these resources highlight this importance: that none can
or should exist in isolation, and exploring one should necessarily mean
exploring the others. In particular, we feature resources that succeed
in demonstrating that the best way to learn the value of praxis is by
*acutally engaging in praxis*. These resources do not just talk about
the importance of praxis in the abstract; They all provide examples of
praxis in action.

### Why Teach Praxis
process, action with specific qualities-action that are humanely
focused;

      digital pedagogy)
    * Guidelines for Use (how to integrate it into a course, what might
      need revision/adaptation)

Feel free to push these resources to a server for remote access, and
then send us the URL. In your Markdown file, you can just include file
names (e.g., screenshot1.png) for our reference, with the annotations
and other information following them. Ultimately, all of your resources
will be intergrated in this repository (curateteaching/digitalpedagogy).

### “Bibliocircuitry and the Design of the Alien Everday”

An article detailing student exploration of the concept of *reflective
design* by investigating the book as interface. The projects perfectly
highlight the way . They also emphasize that *digital* often involves
considerations regarding hardware and physical/tactile design.Teachers
might a particular object or set of objects and ask students to figure
out ways to alter or enhance their interface.

### “Doing Feminist Theory through Digital Video”

professor of [http://sites.stfx.ca/womens_and_gender_studies/](Women's and Gender Studies) at [http://www.stfx.ca/](St. Francis Xavier University) in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.

*Doing Feminist Theory through Digital Video* is a reflective essay detailing Hurst's undergraduate assignment and the literature informing the development of the assignment. Noticing her undergraduates were struggling to connect the rich theoretical discussions within the classroom to 'real life', Hurst details how specific theoretical considerations (e.g. Feminism) shape and can by shaped by praxis applications.

Hurst applies Paulo Freire's definition of praxis, 'reflection and action upon the world in order to change it', to her assignment with the goal of fostering sustained deep relfection, both of the theoretical foundations for her course as well as on the student's emerging scholarly voice.

A semester-long, service-learing project is difficult to integrate into an existing course. Rather, Hurst's article outlines strategies for nurturing deep learning through relfection and praxis. Reflecting on her process as well as implementation, Hurst points to methods for demystifying knowledge creation through itterative, collaborative work.

(Extra)ordinary *Materials* is a course focusing on "thinking and experimenting with materials that have extraordinary properties around ordinary practices as an entry point for identifying new affordances in form-giving work." With a detailed syllabus and a blend of intriguing readings, hands-on experiements, and student participation, (Extra)ordinary *Materials* exemplifies *Praxis* through deep investigations of specific materials along side explorations of the ideas of  "mutability, reproduction, age and belonging."

Readings are paired with hands-on, both individual and class, investigations and reflective reports

* Why is it useful? How does it exemplify digital pedagogy? 
*thoughtful learning outcomes with explicit pairing of hands-on work and theoretical readings to best explore range of materials and properties.
*readings paired with hands-on (individual and class exercises) investigations
*reporting back
*intentional interventions and less intended (less noticed)
interventions such as aging or wear

### “How Did They Make That?”

* What is it?

Posner offers a modest gallery of various digital projects, and breaks
each down into the tools and techniques used in their production. The
goal is to show how each is made, so others might also make similar
projects and build from them.

The site would be a perfect starting point for students before
their own digital projects. Have students visit the site, then visit each example project, to see
how the list of parts and techniques used on a project correspond to
specific results. Get a feel for what different types of projects offer.
