## Curatorial Statement (roughly 750-800 words, MLA Format)

### Vision Statement: How do you envision or understand “praxis” and its
relation to pedagogy?

### Scholarly rationale and criteria for selections: why were the
specific curated resources selected? How did you approach selection?

* We wanted to feature a range of resources: Syllabi that discuss,
  organize, and present praxis to students; Lessons that detail process
  behind a particular praxis assigment and possible outcomes; Project
  showcases that demonstrate completed assigments and reflections on
  those assigments, or elaborate on the tools and process that go into
  making a particular project; Articles that reflect and elaborate on
  the importance of praxis for teaching and learning.
* We wanted to feature resources that demonstrate the interconnected,
  symbiotic relationships between praxis and theory. All of these
  resources highlight this importance; that neither can or should exist
  in isolation, and exploring one should necessarily mean exploring the
  other.
* We wanted to feature resources that do a particularly good job
  demonstrating that the best way to learn the value of praxis is by
  **acutally doing praxis**. These resources do not just talk about the
  importance of praxis in the abstract; They all
* We wanted to select publicly available, open access resources.

### Why teach praxis now? Important issues?



### Particular intersections with your pedagogical philosophy: How and
where do you teach issues related to this keyword? What are learning
outcomes? What resources do you use? What are our students' backgrounds,
interests, or investments?



## Curated Pedagogical Resources (ten resources, each with metadata, a screenshot, and a 150-word annotation)

```
* Screenshot (PNG or JPG), if applicable
* Source URL
* A Copy of the Resource (in HTML, PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, RTF, MP3, MP4,
  MOV, PNG, or JPG), if possible
* Name of Creator
* Attribution Information (Author, University/College)
* An annotation of **no more than 150 words** that includes:
    * Brief statement of Aim/Purpose of the Resource (what is it?)
    * Brief statement on Its Relevance to the Keyword (why is it
      important/useful, what does it do well, how does it exemplify
      digital pedagogy)
    * Guidelines for Use (how to integrate it into a course, what might
      need revision/adaptation)

Feel free to push these resources to a server for remote access, and
then send us the URL. In your Markdown file, you can just include file
names (e.g., screenshot1.png) for our reference, with the annotations
and other information following them. Ultimately, all of your resources
will be intergrated in this repository (curateteaching/digitalpedagogy).
